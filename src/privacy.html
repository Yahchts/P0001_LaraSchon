                            happens to your personal data when you visit our website. Personal data is any data by which
                            you can be personally identified. For more detailed information on data protection, please
                            refer to our data protection statement below this text.</p>

                            Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator.<br>

                            How do we collect your data?<br>

                            On the one hand, your data is collected when you provide it to us. This may, for example, be
                            data that you enter in a contact form. Other data is collected automatically by our IT
                            systems when you visit the website. This is mainly technical data (e.g. internet browser,
                            operating system or time of page view). This data is collected automatically as soon as you
                            enter our website.<br>

                            What do we use your data for?<br>

                            Part of the data is collected in order to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other
                            data may be used to analyse your user behaviour.<br>

                            What rights do you have regarding your data?<br>

                            You have the right to receive information free of charge at any time about the origin,
                            recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have the right to demand the
                            correction, blocking or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time at the address
                            given in the imprint for this purpose and for further questions on the subject of data
                            protection. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent
                            supervisory authority. You also have the right to request the restriction of the processing
                            of your personal data under certain circumstances. For details, please refer to the data
                            protection declaration under "Right to restriction of processing".</p>

                            statistically analysed. This is done primarily with cookies and with so-called analysis
                            programs. The analysis of your surfing behaviour is usually anonymous; the surfing behaviour
                            cannot be traced back to you. You can object to this analysis or prevent it by not using
                            certain tools. You will find detailed information on this in the following data protection
                            declaration. You can object to this analysis. We will inform you about the possibilities of

                            data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the
                            statutory data protection regulations and this data protection declaration. When you use
                            this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data by which you can be
                            personally identified. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and how we
                            use it. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done. We would like to point out
                            that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security
                            gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

                            The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines
                            the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail addresses or
                            similar).</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">Revocation of your consent to data processing</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">
                            Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke
                            consent you have already given at any time. All you need to do is send us an informal
                            e-mail. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
                            unaffected by the revocation.</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct
                            advertising (Art. 21 DSGVO)</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">If data processing is carried out on the basis of Art. 6(1)(e) or
                            (f) DSGVO, you have the right to object to the processing of your personal data at any time
                            on grounds relating to your particular situation; this also applies to profiling based on
                            these provisions. The respective legal basis on which processing is based can be found in
                            this data protection declaration. If you object, we will no longer process your personal
                            data concerned unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing
                            which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the purpose of
                            asserting, exercising or defending legal claims (objection under Article 21(1) of the GDPR).
                            If your personal data are processed for the purpose of direct marketing, you have the right
                            to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of
                            such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct
                            marketing. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for the
                            purpose of direct advertising (objection pursuant to Art. 21 (2) DSGVO).</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">Right of complaint to the competent supervisory authority</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the
                            right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State
                            of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The
                            right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">Right to data portability</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">You have the right to have data that we process automatically on
                            the basis of your consent or in performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third
                            party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data
                            to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">SSL or TLS encryption</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">For security reasons and to protect the transmission of
                            confidential content, such as orders or enquiries that you send to us as the site operator,
                            this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact
                            that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock
                            symbol in your browser line. If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to
                            us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">Information, blocking, deletion and correction</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have
                            the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and
                            recipient and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction,
                            blocking or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the
                            subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the
                            imprint.</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">Right to restriction of processing</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of
                            your personal data. To do this, you can contact us at any time at the address given in the
                            imprint. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:<br>

                            - If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to
                            check this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the
                            restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br>

                            - If the processing of your personal data has happened / is happening unlawfully, you can
                            request the restriction of data processing instead of erasure.<br>

                            - If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert
                            legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal
                            data instead of erasure.<br>

                            - If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our
                            interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests
                            prevail, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal
                            data.<br>

                            If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data may - apart from
                            being stored - only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defence
                            of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or
                            for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>

                        <p class="privacy__highlight">Objection to advertising e-mails</p>
                        <p class="privacy__paragraph">We hereby object to the use of contact data published within the
                            scope of the imprint obligation to send advertising and information material that has not
                            been expressly requested. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take
                            legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example
                            by spam e-mails.</p>

                            stored on your terminal device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognise
                            your browser on your next visit. You can set your browser so that you are informed about the
                            setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of

                            limited. Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process or to

                            on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest
                            in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimised provision of its services.
                            Insofar as other cookies (e.g. cookies to analyse your surfing behaviour) are stored, these
                            are dealt with separately in this data protection declaration.</p>

                            The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator
                            has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimisation of its
                            website - for this purpose, the server log files must be collected.</p>

                            The processing of the data entered in the contact form is therefore based exclusively on

                            this purpose, an informal communication by e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the
                            data processing operations carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
                            revocation.<br>
                            The data you entered in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete
                            it, revoke your consent to store it or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies
                            (e.g. after we have completed processing your request). Mandatory legal provisions - in
                            particular retention periods - remain unaffected.</p>

                        <p class="privacy__paragraph"> We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our

                            USA ("Google").<br>

                            The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether data entry on our websites (e.g. in a contact
                            form) is made by a human or by an automated programme. For this purpose, reCAPTCHA analyses
                            the behaviour of the website visitor on the basis of various characteristics. This analysis
                            begins automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis,
                            reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, time spent by the website visitor
                            on the website or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis
                            is forwarded to Google.<br>

                            The reCAPTCHA analyses run entirely in the background. Website visitors are not informed
                            that an analysis is taking place.<br>

                            The data processing is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website operator has a
                            legitimate interest in protecting its web offers from abusive automated spying and from
                            SPAM.<br>
